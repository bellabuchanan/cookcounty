		     There’s a lot of mixing around. The PSA recommending "release with no conditions" doesn’t mean that they will be released on an "I-Bond." And this isn’t necessarily bad in itself. Judges are not required to follow the recommended guidelines outlined by the PSA and take into account factors such as the details of the case and comments from the defendant and the prosecutor. When it becomes a problem, is when the judge decides on bail conditions (that do not align with the PSA recommendation) that prevent someone from leaving jail.</p>
